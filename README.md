Lately, cryptocurrencies have gained a lot of popularity in the finance sector owing to the massive returns, they have been offering since last few years. There are more than thousands of cryptocurrencies that have been generated.  

This project focuses on the top 25 cryptocurrencies as they constitute more than 90% of the cryptocurrency market capitalization. The idea is to focus on the cryptocurrencies which are currently trending based on the historical returns as well as based on the sentiments across various social media platforms. 

This is an interesting problem to make public aware of the highly trending cryptocurrencies and guide them while doing the investments. The project identifies top 10 cryptocurrencies based on market cap, social media attention on Reddit, Twitter and Cryptocompare. Additionally, based on the current price of the cryptocurrency and the technical indicator, the project also suggests whether a particular cryptocurrency shows a bullish signal or a bearish signal or is neutral.
